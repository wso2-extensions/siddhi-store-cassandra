Find some useful links below: Source code Releases Issue tracker Latest API Docs Latest API Docs is 2.0.1 . Prerequisites A Cassandra server instance should be started and available for connection via the DataStax Java API. How to use Using the extension in WSO2 Stream Processor You can use this extension in the latest WSO2 Stream Processor that is a part of WSO2 Analytics offering, with editor, debugger and simulation support. This extension is shipped out-of-the-box with WSO2 Stream Processor, if you wish to use an alternative version of this extension you can replace the component jar that can be found in the STREAM_PROCESSOR_HOME /lib directory. When running the product make sure to insert the DataStax Java Driver For Apache Cassandra to STREAM_PROCESSOR_HOME /lib directory. Using the extension as a java library This extension can be added as a maven dependency along with other Siddhi dependencies to your project. dependency groupId org.wso2.extension.siddhi.store.cassandra /groupId artifactId siddhi-store-cassandra /artifactId version x.x.x /version /dependency Special notes In case of using search, make sure to include the primary key of the data containing column. If the primary key is not declared by the user the performance of the Siddhi search query will be reduced. In case of deleting data from the store, including primary key will increase the efficiency of the Siddhi query. Otherwise whole entire table will be searched and then found rows will be deleted, which will effect the performance of the query. The same scenario applies in updating and update or insert operations. Make sure to build a proper Cassandra cluster with configured hosts. Jenkins Build Status Branch Build Status master Features cassandra ( Store ) This extension assigns data sources and connection instructions to event tables. It also implements read-write operations on connected datasource. How to Contribute Please report issues at GitHub Issue Tracker . Send your contributions as pull requests to master branch . Contact us Post your questions with the \"Siddhi\" tag in Stackoverflow . Siddhi developers can be contacted via the mailing lists: Developers List : dev@wso2.org Architecture List : architecture@wso2.org Support We are committed to ensuring support for this extension in production. Our unique approach ensures that all support leverages our open development methodology and is provided by the very same engineers who build the technology.
