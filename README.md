## How to use 

**Using the extension in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wso2/product-sp">WSO2 Stream Processor</a>**

* You can use this extension in the latest <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wso2/product-sp/releases">WSO2 Stream Processor</a> that is a part of <a target="_blank" href="http://wso2.com/analytics?utm_source=gitanalytics&utm_campaign=gitanalytics_Jul17">WSO2 Analytics</a> offering, with editor, debugger and simulation support. 

* This extension is shipped out-of-the-box with WSO2 Stream Processor, if you wish to use an alternative version of this extension you can replace the component <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wso2-extensions/siddhi-store-cassandra/releases">jar</a> that can be found in the `<STREAM_PROCESSOR_HOME>/lib` directory.

* When running the product make sure to insert the DataStax Java Driver For Apache Cassandra to `<STREAM_PROCESSOR_HOME>/lib` directory.

**Using the extension as a <a target="_blank" href="https://wso2.github.io/siddhi/documentation/running-as-a-java-library">java library</a>**

* This extension can be added as a maven dependency along with other Siddhi dependencies to your project.

```
     <dependency>
        <groupId>org.wso2.extension.siddhi.store.cassandra</groupId>
        <artifactId>siddhi-store-cassandra</artifactId>
        <version>x.x.x</version>
     </dependency>
```
**Special notes**

* In case of using search, make sure to include the primary key of the data containing column. If the primary 
key is not declared by the user the performance of the Siddhi search query will be reduced.

* In case of deleting data from the store, including primary key will increase the efficiency of the Siddhi query.
Otherwise whole entire table will be searched and then found rows will be deleted, which will effect the 
performance of the query.

* The same scenario applies in updating and update or insert operations.

* Make sure to build a proper Cassandra cluster with configured hosts.
